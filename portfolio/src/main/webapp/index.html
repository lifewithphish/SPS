          My name is Meleah, but I go by Mel. I love hiking, climbing, and working 
          on projects. I am studying Computer Engineering, but find myself just as
          excited about learning to code! I love being outdoors and exploring the 
          mountains. Maybe it's a side effect of growing up in the flat state of 
          Texas, but going to the mountains always brings me so much joy. I plan to
          attempt the Seven Summits one day. I also enjoy working on old cars and have
          been fixing up my truck in my free time.

                I also participated in the Space Settlment Design Competition, first as 
                a student and later as a mentor, working to solve problems associated with
                living and working in space in a think-tank style contest.

                through more than 60 obstacles. It took over twelve hours to finish.
